      "The traffic problem in Bengaluru is so bad that by an unspoken agreement, the citizens have decided not to speak about it. When you are late for an appointment, it is no longer acceptable to say, “Well, the traffic, you know …” Everyone knows, so why bring it up? Instead, we say something like, “Our clothes weren’t back from the laundry” or “We were busy watching a tree grow.” We hate to make our politicians feel bad. \n",

      "We also hope that the less we talk about the traffic problems, the faster they will disappear. It is a legacy from childhood when we believed that the best way to make something happen was not to talk about it. There is a school of thought which believes we should follow the Italian model and allow vehicles on the footpath. But the supporters of this school had to shut up when it was pointed out that such is already the case. ‘Footpath’ or ‘sidewalk’ (for those who had their education in America) is, like the woolly mammoth, entirely extinct, remembered only by those who have forgotten everything else. Carpooling, where people going in the same direction hop into the same car to save on time, fuel and amount spent on road repairs, worked for a bit till some of us concluded that we needed a law preventing eleven people from travelling in a single car. I exaggerate, but have you commuted to work in a car bearing six, and started your day at the office smelling of other people’s sweat? My idea is that no one should be allowed to leave home without first ensuring that someone who had been out had returned. That way the number of people on the road remains a constant, a number that can be worked out in advance. Computers will let us know who has come back in and who is head of the queue to go out. Also Read | Road accidents are on the rise on Bengaluru streets; overspeeding, lack of awareness and infrastructure gaps blamedBut people might complain they had to stay at home for 18 months because their computer, which had a problem could not be fixed as no repairmen had got their turn yet. So perhaps not such a good idea after all. There has been some loose talk of public transport, buses and trains and the like, but it hasn’t got anywhere. Laying roads and tracks would take up too much time, and schoolchildren now would become grandfathers and grandmothers before that happened. Governments seem to have a horror of finishing projects on time. While the rest of us work and stretch our money as far as it will go, our politicians stretch the work to see how far the money will go. “Everything is as it should be,” said a friend quoting a philosopher who was either Greek or French, he didn’t know which. And that’s where the matter rests now, with the citizens convinced that everything is as it should be, and that all traffic problems are maya, illusion. Who said philosophers were useless in practical life?\n",

A few days ago, popular British author Jeffrey Archer was in the city to launch his latest book when he had a taste of Bangalore's notorious traffic jams.\"A woman walking on the pavement overtook my car eight times and my car overtook her eight times. Two more times and we would have been engaged,\" he later told the more than 3,000 fans who had gathered for the event. The writer's humour made his fans smile, but many Bangaloreans stuck daily in the city's nightmarish jams are not amused.I've visited Bangalore many times in the past, but this time whenever I called anyone to fix an appointment, the directions came with a warning, \"Start early to factor in traffic delays.\"Image source, WRI IndiaImage caption, Reports say an average citizen spends more than 240 hours stuck in jams every year\"The traffic is definitely a mess here,\" says transport and traffic expert Prof MN Sreehari. \"It's faster to walk than drive.\"\"In 2005, traffic moved at the speed of 35km (22 miles) an hour; in 2014, it had slowed down to 9.2km (5.7 miles),\" says Pawan Mulukutla of the non-profit World Resource Institute, adding that \"at traffic junctions, the wait time is more than five minutes when it should ideally be two-three minutes.\"Today, at peak times, the speed is just 4-5km on the city's key Outer Ring Road.Reports say an average citizen spends more than 240 hours stuck in jams every year and Prof Sreehari estimates that traffic delays cost the city 65bn rupees ($950m; Â£760m) a year.So why is Bangalore gridlocked?Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, The Metro construction is stuck in the slow laneEveryone I spoke to agreed that it was because of the rapid - and unplanned - growth of the city.Bangalore is often described as the Silicon Valley of India as it is home to the IT industry. Since the early 1990s, global technology firms began opening offices here and a large number of support industries have grown around it, bringing with them a huge influx of people from all over India.\"Bangalore became the new El Dorado,\" says city resident V Ravichandar. \"And the population grew from 5.6 million in 2001 to 8.7 million in 2011. Today, it's estimated to have reached 11.5 million.\"Mr Mulukutla says the population has doubled, but the infrastructure has failed to keep pace. Image source, Kashif MasoodImage caption, Traffic delays cost the city 65bn rupees ($950m; Â£760m) a year\"We have only 6,500-7,000 public buses to carry 45% of the city's traffic. The Metro construction has been very slow. Work on the first line started in 2007 and so far only 28km of the 42km line have opened. Work on the second phase has not even begun. And deadlines keep getting pushed.\"So most people are dependent on private transport. Prof Sreehari says the city has 6.6 million private vehicles, including one million cars. And every day, another million vehicles enter from outside the city, clogging its already choked streets.Adding to the problem, he says, is the fact that one-third of the city roads are taken away by parking and encroachments.The woman whose daughter's death led her to save othersThanksgiving traffic jam is 'most epic'\"Roads are meant for traffic, but there's parking everywhere. Footpaths are meant for pedestrians, but they are occupied by hawkers and vendors.\"So is there a way out?\"We need firm decisions from the authorities, but there is a lack of vision,\" believes Prof Sreehari. \"More than 3,500 vehicles are registered in the city daily. That number needs to be restricted. We need to make licensing stricter, car purchases should be taxed heavily and heavy fines should be charged to curb roadside parking,\" he says.Image source, Kashif MasoodImage caption, More than 3,500 vehicles are registered in the city dailyMr Ravichandar says the answer lies in faster public transport. \"We need more investment in public transport. If we increase the number of buses to 9,500 to 10,000, it will make a difference,\" he says.\"The government instead comes up with ideas like constructing a steel bridge and elevated corridors,\" says Mr Mulukutla.\"Building new flyovers can change the pain point, but they are not a permanent solution,\" he adds.Prof Sreehari says any new flyover will be clogged in five years.\"What we need is a comprehensive integrated sustainable public transport system, something like a central transport authority like you have in London or Singapore. Our culture of working in silos and different transport systems, not talking to each other, is not going to work.\"But as that is unlikely to happen soon, the situation is \"expected to get worse before it gets better\", says Mr Ravichandar.Bangalore, at least in the near future, will continue to remain gridlocked.More on this storyChina traffic dance video goes viralPublished17 November 2016Thanksgiving traffic jam is 'most epic'Published23 November 2016Top StoriesImran Khan given second jail sentence in two daysPublished1 hour agoLive.Â Tech CEOs to face tough questions on child safety onlineInjured, hungry and alone - the Gazan children orphaned by warPublished9 hours agoFeaturesA jailed star and former convict: Pakistan's election, explainedInjured, hungry and alone - the Gazan children orphaned by warWatch: âGod Mum, please leaveâ â The struggle to exit a town under attackZambian families grieve as cholera kills loved onesWho is Viktor Orban, Hungary's PM halting funds for Ukraine?'I regret posting online that I was Madeleine McCann'What options does US have to respond to Jordan attack?Nothing but rubble: Ukraine's shattered ghost town AvdiivkaSecret calls and code names: How money makes it to N KoreaElsewhere on the BBCThe truth about burnoutWhy 'living retro' is perfect for nowA 75km hike through 'the Graveyard of the Pacific'Most Read1Imran Khan given second jail sentence in two days2Chinese mafia bosses behind scam centres arrested3Where Biden v Trump will be won and lost4Judge annuls Musk's 'unfathomable' $56bn Tesla pay5Putin challenger submits bid to run for president6Adele announces 'random' Munich residency7India has 718 snow leopards, shows first-ever survey8Iran-backed group suspends attacks against US9Thai reformist party could be dissolved after court loss10Elmo responds to 'world is on fire' angstBBC News ServicesOn your mobileOn smart speakersGet news alertsContact BBC NewsHomeNewsSportEarthReelWorklifeTravelCultureFutureMusicTVWeatherSoundsTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCGet Personalised NewslettersWhy you can trust the BBCAdvertise with usÂ© 2024 BBC.
